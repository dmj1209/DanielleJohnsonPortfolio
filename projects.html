						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">TENETS:</span> Work Ethic, Writing Skills</p>-->
						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->This site was made for an English project in which each group was tasked with making a newspaper satirizing our school. Instead of making a drawing, pdf, or even a site from a template, our group decided to utilize our web design knowledge to code the site ourselves. Our goal was to make it similar to the our school's online newspaper, the Southwest Shadow. Because not everyone in the group was a web student, I coded majority of the HTML and CSS on the site. I wanted to arrange it specifically to show off the actual content of the project while being functional at the same time and mimicking a real newspaper.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> This project, although not assigned for web design, was great practice for web design. At this point, our class had been learning how to make sites for only a few months, so I was very proud of what I accomplished. The arrangement of a lot of the pages was tricky, not having very much experience with multiple columns before. In making the site, I was able to learn things I didn't know by deciding what aspects I wanted and then testing different code to find out what worked. This project really allowed me to apply what had just been learned in class on my own. I still use a lot of the code learned in this project in my coding today.</p>
						<p class="project-p">This project falls under work ethic because I worked for a very long time trying to perfect the code and correct errors. It also falls under writing skills because our team wrote all of the articles and I used my acquired coding skills to write the code.</p>-->

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">TENETS:</span> Professional Communication, Teamwork/Collaboration, Writing Skills</p>-->
						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span>-->This site was made at the end of my sophomore year for our first client, English teacher Mr. Moore. The goal was to make a site that his future classes could utilize when they read Dante's Inferno. We were in teams of five, each person responsible for a different part- sitemap & wireframe, mockup, hosting research, HTML, and CSS. I was responsible for all CSS on the site. Our plan was to make the site look clean and modern with the big banners and circular images, but also be functional and useful for the students. Before coding, we were responsible for developing all of the content on the site, including the Inferno level descriptions, middle ages information, and other works Dante Aligheri wrote.</p>
						<p class="project-p">The full site can be found <a class="web-links" href="http://swcta.net/teachers/changcl/dante/DARKE/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> Being that this was my first website for a client, it went very well. Also being my first group website, my team worked together well too and everyone did their individual job. CSS was something I had felt unsure about coming into the project, especially because it was solely my responsibility, but having a mockup to base my design off of proved helpful. I learned that good design starts with the mockup because if you have a good mockup, and code your site to match, everything works out well. However, if you say it's fine and that you'll change things once you start coding, there are more problems. Our team worked very smoothly, everyone contributing to their work and then passing it off to the next person. I was very proud of the finished product because it matched our vision and paid attention to the small details like making a "descend" button in the levels and making the current page a different color in the navigation bar.</p>
						<p class="project-p">This project falls under Professional Communication because we successfully presented it to our client and other judges, Teamwork/Collaboration because our group worked together to help where needed, and Writing Skills because I used my knowledge in writing CSS to style the site.</p>-->

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->This project was completed in teams of two and focused on using previously learned JavaScript to create a web quiz. The quiz included a total of forty questions, ten each on the history of the web, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There were many required elements of JavaScript including NaN, random number generator, conditional statements, and more. My team's quiz consisted of a welcome page, a questionnaire, a quiz page, and a thank you page. Our form included a text box, radio buttons, checkboxes, a drop-down menu, and "not a number." The quiz itself included variables, "getElementById," arrays, and more.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> This was one of the hardest web projects because JavaScript was such a new concept for us and we weren't too familiar with it. Each little piece of JavaScript took a lot of labor to do, and every aspect that worked was a small victory. I'm proud of the final product, considering our concerns beginning the project. The project gave us a much better understanding of JavaScript and specifically functions. All of the information learned will likely be used in future projects as well.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">TENETS:</span> Teamwork/Collaboration, Use of Resources, Work Ethic</p>-->
						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span>-->The Hour of Code is a global movement to teach coding and show that anyone can learn. It takes place every year at our school and is put together by the Web Design junior class. This year, however, there was a twist. Our class took the Hour of Code to Fine Elementary to teach the kids there the basics of coding. I was one of the head managers for this project and helped with over a month of planning. We designed a logo, scheduled rotations, made flyers and posters, sent instruction packets to teachers, and planned activities for each grade. </p>
						<p class="project-p">The site for the SWCTA/Fine Hour of Code can be found <a class="web-links" href="http://swcta.net/teachers/changcl/IT2016/" target="_blank">here</a> and for code.org <a class="web-links" href="https://code.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> Being a head manager for this year's Hour of Code was extremely stressful, but definitely worth it. Because this was the first year the Hour of Code was held somewhere new, we had no example to go off of and had much more work to do. Everything went well, but some timeframes were thrown off because Fine started school at 9:00 AM so we couldn't get in until after then, although we had planned on being set up prior to 9:00. Many rotations had to be shortened and some videos were not played to try to get back into the schedule. This required so much communication between section managers in the school and student instructors in the classrooms to make sure everyone rotated alright. All of the kids loved it though, and we were invited back next year already. Having this experience under our belt will definitely allow us to help the juniors when they plan it next year.</p>
						<p class="project-p">This project falls under Teamwork/Collaboration because I worked with the other head manager, marketing manager, website manager, and curriculum manager. This also falls under Use of Resources because our activities required many assets, and Work Ethic because this project showed my work ethic more than anything else I've ever done.</p>-->

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->As a follow-up to the Hour of Code and as part of my SkillsUSA Community Service Project, myself and the other head manager and marketing manager applied for the CUE Student Powered Showcase. The Student Powered Showcase is an event which showcases science, math, engineering, and technology projects to teachers. Our group was selected out of 30 entries to be one of the 11 to attend. Our plan is to take the Hour of Code to the SPS and have participants play some of the games we played with the kids at Fine. The overall goal is to show them the fundamentals of coding in a fun way and show the importance of coding to their everyday lives.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> The showcase takes place on March 19, 2016 in Palm Springs so we are looking forward to attending and are currently preparing. Being chosen for us means that the judges cared about our project and thought that it deserved a spot at the showcase. This project will be beneficial to our project at the SkillsUSA state competition. As we present the Hour of Code as our community service project, we wil be able to use this showcase as a leg up on the competition and as an extra source to support it.</p>
						<p class="project-p">This project falls under Teamwork/Collaboration because there is a group of three of us working to make it a success, Use of Resources because we are utilizing the same assets used in the Hour of Code, and Writing Skills because the entry for the showcase required answering a series of questions.</p>-->

Building the site in WordPress was actually fun, but involved many challenges. It was great being able to modify everything from the base theme “underscores,” but it was also intimidating starting from nothing. Our team had some trouble with responsiveness as we had to create more than just three media queries and had some problems with floats and resizing tables.

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->The self portrait was my first big assignment in Graphic Design I. It was also my first Adobe Illustrator project completed just after learning the program. The assignment was simply to take a picture of yourself and recreate it in Illustrator to make a self-portrait. While making the picture, it was recommended to use many tools in the program, such as the pen tool, gradients, shape tool, and many others. By using all of these tools, the goal was to make my portrait realistic, especially by using shadows.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> Although it didn't turn out exactly how I wanted, I was still proud of the finished product. I had never used Illustrator before and didn't have it at home either. I use Illustrator so much now so the things I learned while doing this project really acted as my foundation in the program. I learned about many Illustrator techniques and tools and was able to play around with new ones that we hadn't even learned. I was proud specifically of the shadows I created to make it more realistic and the use of many different tools in the creation of the portrait.</p>

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->In teams of two, we were assigned to pick a topic and convey information on it through an infographic. An infographic, just as it sounds, is a representation of information through some kind of graphic. In this case our class used previous knowledge of Adobe Illustrator to create our infographics. Our team chose to explore dogs and display information such as smartest dog breeds, most popular dog states, dog population in the US, AKC recognized breeds, and a dog's senses. We tried to put a somewhat unique spin on traditional infographics with unique colors and dog graphics.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> My team's infographic overall was a success. We effectively conveyed the information in an organized way. If we were to make it again or revise it, there would be a few design elements that we would have changed. The transparencies on each section's backgrounds should probably be removed or cover the whole background to eliminate problems in reading or seeing the information. A few of the graphics, while individually nice, did not match the whole theme of the infographic. I also might have preferred a different font for the text typeface. None of those were major issues though, and I think the project was mostly a success because of the quality of information and unique graphics.</p>

This was my first Sketchbook Pro Project. I wanted a creative photo to work with so I chose to take a picture of my soccer cleats from a unique angle. Along with painting the shoes, I had to split up the picture into four sections- one for each type of color scheme. The left side is complementary, the right is analogous, the top is monochromatic, and the bottom is warm colors.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> This project was one of my favorites because I loved the idea of painting in a computer program. I was especially proud of how I blended the colors together to produce gradients, specifically on the shoes. I thought the shoes came out very realistic and I utilized the various color schemes well. If I could have changed it up a little bit, I would have liked to change the places I divided the picture. I think I could have been a little more creative in the way I split it up, and I also could have cleaned up a few areas like the shoelaces. Overall though, I was very satisfied with how it turned out, especially never having used the program Sketchbook Pro before.</p>

The conference was held at Lake Tahoe so my preparation for the logo involved research on both NACTE itself and Lake Tahoe. I started with 20 sketches and chose my favorite one. I developed that into my final logo which was my simple representation of Lake Tahoe. I wanted to represent the location of the conference and include NACTE on the mountains similar to the Hollywood Sign. The NACTE slogan, "CTE: A Vision for Tomorrow," is also included on the ground and reflected in the water.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> For being my first logo creation, I think this was a good start. It matched the idea I had in mind and turned out very clean cut. While this did demonstrate my knowledge of Illustrator, I could have reflected my knowledge of CTE a little more and should have probably incorporated that more. It also may have been better to make it slightly more like a logo, meaning making NACTE more front and center. During this project, I also learned that when you design logos, you should make black and white versions in the event that they need to be printed in that specific way.</p>

I chose to challenge myself by using Photoshop, a program I felt I wasn't extremely good at using. I thought it would be fun to create a card using my dog as the eight reindeer and Rudolph pulling me as Santa in a sled. This card required incorporating so many elements like a border, background picture, sled, reindeer harnesses, a collar, and antlers. While I wanted to make the card fun, I also had a goal to make it look good and professional, or at least well-made.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> I consider this project my first success in Photoshop. I was able to incorporate so many different aspects I wanted and I think I did a pretty good job. Usually trying to fit together so many things would cause disaster, but paying attention to each detail really helped not make the card look like a mess. I learned so many different parts of Photoshop I had never used before. For example, I showed proficiency in clipping masks, the quick selection tool, opacity, painting, and more.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">TENETS:</span> Content Knowledge, Work Ethic</p>-->
						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->The first part of this project was to recreate a piece of fine art in Adobe Flash. I chose to make Vincent van Gogh's "Wheat Field with Cypresses." For the second part, I had to animate the art with Flash. I wanted to make the painting fun by adding snow. I decided to build up the snow and have a snowman build up piece by piece, starting with the snowballs, then eyes, mouth, nose, buttons, arms, and top hat. This was my first project with Flash, so I had to use many unfamiliar tools, as well at the motion editor to keyframe movements.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> After completing this first Flash project, I was more than satisfied with the outcome. I made a very detailed animation, more than just moving the clouds or grass. This project demonstrated knowledge in keyframing individual objects to come together into one animation. Much of the knowledge learned in the creation of this project was able to be used in future Flash projects. I also learned how to use Flash almost like Illustrator to create objects.</p>
						<p class="project-p">This project falls under Content Knowledge because of the new knowledge learned in Flash, and Work Ethic because I went above and beyond to make a detailed and longer animation.</p>-->

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->As a follow up to the previous Flash project, I was tasked to demonstrate what I learned by animating a fable. My fable was called "The Mountain and the Mouse" by Aesop. I used a good deal of information learned in the previous project to animate this fable. I also used Illustrator to animate most of the pieces before putting them together in Flash. This project also required the use of many scenes throughout. I tried to make everything as detailed as possible, from the gradients to the mouths moving when characters talked.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION: </span>This project for me confirmed the knowledge I had in Flash. The attention to detail I showed really reflected my understanding of Flash, the motion editor, keyframing, and scenes. I also learned a lot more about symbols in Flash because I needed some pieces in multiple scenes. Audio was also a big part of the project as we had to record audio and learn how to place it into the animation. With the newfound understanding I had of the program, I feel confident going forward and completing more projects in Adobe Flash.</p>
						<p class="project-p">This project falls under Content Knowledge because it demonstrated my knowledge in Flash, and Work Ethic because I worked extra hard to make each detail of the animation.</p>-->

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->The assignment for this project was to create a poster that could be used to represent the Brian Head Arts Festival in Utah during July 2015. I decided to use Adobe Illustrator to create my poster, but before I started I researched Brian Head and art festivals. I wanted to convey both the unique tourist town of Brian Head, but also incorporate the aspect of the art festival. I did this by recreating Brian Head's mountain and placing the arts festival going on below. I put the whole thing in a polaroid frame to represent it as a photograph of the event and kind of as a tourist attraction or postcard. I also worked very hard to place tiny details under each tent of the different types of art they might have.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> After all of the posters were judged, my design came in 7th place. I was happy that my hard work reflected in the outcome. Because I used Illustrator for the entire poster, I learned a lot more about the program. I also continued my development with the pen tool because of how much I used it for the details of the art under the tents. This project overall confirmed my ability to use Illustrator. I also learned about my own creative style in the way I made the mountain and water unique and the minimalist style of the tents.</p>
						<p class="project-p">This project falls under Use of Resources because of the outside research done on Brianhead, and Work Ethic because of the details in the poster.</p>-->

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->For this Flash project, we were assigned in groups of two to create a shooter game. The game was based off of a Lynda course, but we replaced the graphics with our own and followed along with the coding. Our game was called "Tip a Cow" and the goal was to hit the cows with your hand. If you miss three before the time is up you lose the game. Our plan was to simulate a carnival game where the objects move around and you have to hit them to win. The cows grow bigger on the screen and the pigs move in the background to distract the player.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> This was my first experience coding in Flash and it was very difficult. If we strayed too much from the example code, problems would occur. However, we worked hard to make our game unique and different from the example game. We succeeded in our goal of making a visually appealing game that was functional as well. This project required learning a lot of new coding in Flash that was very different than our everyday website coding.</p>
						<p class="project-p">This project falls under Teamwork/Collaboration because my partner and I worked well together to complete the finished game, and Writing Skills because we had to learn and write a lot of new code.</p>-->

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->For this project we spent months on and off exploring a particular theme. I looked at dogs, and more specifically dog adoption. I explored various ways to present my final project including fonts, colors, and artists known for adoption art. I also ended up using both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. My final product was made by tracing pictures I've taken of dogs from Furgotten Friends Dog Rescue, the group I volunteer with. I chose one image to be big in the center and the rest to be in the background. For me, these dogs capture the theme of adoption because they are truly up for adoption and all need loving homes.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> This project was one of my favorite Graphic Design projects because it incorporated my love of dogs and adoption with design. This project also incorporated Illustrator aspects into the final Photoshop project. I think the final product was a success because of the overall feeling it conveyed. The paper, paint, drawings, and font all fit well together. Each project continues to add onto my skill set in these two programs.</p>

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->For the 80th anniversary of marketing education, our class was asked to create logos for client Melissa Scott. We started by researching marketing and celebration images. I started with 16 sketches and narrowed it down to three to create in Adobe Illustrator. As part of the logo creation, I developed the logo from start to finish showing my design process with changes in fonts, colors, and orientation. I also created videos explaining my logo development and design process.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> I'm happy with how the logo turned out in the end. It came out nice and simple, and I felt it represented education well with two common symbols for it. In the process of creating this logo, I learned how to document my design process. I learned the importance of it as well since having past versions of logos allows to see changes and consider different paths. Although my logo was not selected, I was chosen to present it at one of our school's Parent Advisory Council meetings because of how well I demonstrated knowledge of the design process.</p>

						<p class="project-p"><!--<span class="bold">EXPLANATION:</span> -->For the 60th year of the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, our class was asked to make logos. I began by researching the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance and trying to learn more about it. I then sketched 10 logos that I thought would represent Las Vegas, LVGEA, or both. I chose my two favorites and made composite sketches and then took them into Illustrator. My first logo has five mountains to represent the five areas of Las Vegas that LVGEA serves. I also wanted to capture the feeling of climbing a mountain and making your mark at the top. The second logo captures the "global" aspect of LVGEA and represents businesses relocating to Las Vegas with the help of LVGEA.</p>

						<!--<p class="project-p"><span class="bold">REFLECTION:</span> My goal coming into this logo was to make something that represented Las Vegas and LVGEA well, and I think I did that. I continued to demonstrate my knowledge of Illustrator and am continuously developing my skills in designing logos. I learned more about the development of logos as I tested different colors and positions. I also learned about creating meaning in each aspect and detail of a logo. I also dealt with clients for the second time and understood the importance of listening to their needs and trying to accomodate them.</p>
